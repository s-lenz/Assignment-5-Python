# Overview
The purpose of this repository is to document my walk through of the SciPy tutorial and store the graphs.

# Assignment 5 – Python Machine Learning Walkthrough

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that walks through the creation and validation of machine learning models in Python, based on exercises from the SciPy Lecture Notes applied to the iris dataset. The goal is to practice applying common statistical and plotting techniques that will be useful in future data analysis labs.
